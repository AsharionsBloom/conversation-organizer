# ChatGPT Conversation Organizer

This tool converts your official ChatGPT `conversations.json` export into individual Markdown (`.md`) files suitable for use with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/),
where plugins like Dataview and Smart Connections offer better organization and search than the native ChatGPT app or web interface.

**Classification module (optional):**

* Uses an LLM (e.g., Google Gemini or Ollama-backed models) to auto-assign tags from a user-defined tag list.

**Note:** Configuration files are not tracked in version control.

* Store model API info and keys in `config/gemini.json` or `config/ollama.json`
* Store tag definitions (with descriptions) in `config/user_tags.json`
