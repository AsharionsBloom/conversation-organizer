# ChatGPT Conversation Organizer

This tool converts your official ChatGPT `conversations.json` export into individual Markdown (`.md`) files suitable for use with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
Each file includes YAML front matter with metadata and conversation statistics.

### ‚ú® Features

**Conversion highlights:**

* Splits each conversation into a standalone Markdown file
* Supports rendering of:
  * Search tool results with URLs
  * Canvas code
  * LaTeX blocks for display in Obsidian


> ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently, images and audio content in conversations are **not supported** by the converter.




**Classification module (optional):**

* Uses an LLM (e.g., Google Gemini or Ollama-backed models) to:

  * Suggest a more descriptive title
  * Auto-assign user-defined tags

Note: Configuration files are not tracked in version control.

   * Store your model API info and keys in config/gemini.json or config/ollama.json.

   * User tags with descriptions go in config/user_tags.json.
